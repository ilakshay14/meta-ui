# Welcome to Meta UI! üéâ

## Intro

**It is just the begining!**

I've been meaning to work on this since a long time. And now since I've finally got it up & running, I would request you to try it out. Would love to hear your feedback on how I can improve this and make it better.

It is just in the early stages. I have decided to name it as Meta UI, after the concept of metahumans from DC universe - yes, I am a DC fan! Meta UI's super power is its simplicity and flexibiltiy - you can use it out of box or pass your custom style to modify it completely!

I am still thinking about its branding which is why you'll see many components looking very basic.

So stay tuned for a lot updates, and do give this a shot and let me know your thoughts on how I can make it better.

Cheers! ü•É ‚ù£Ô∏è

## Installation

I will be creating fresh packages soon but for now...

```
yarn add @ilakshay14/comp-lib
```
OR
```
npm install @ilakshay14/comp-lib
```

## Requesting a new component

1. For Non-Members - I am not taking any external requests right now since this is at a very early stage.
2. For Members - 
   * create an issue.
   * create a task in the board with proper description.
   * attatch the component design in the task.
   * follow the dev process.
   * when ready for review, raise a PR and publish to chromatic.
